HTML plays a crucial role in developing the structure of our system. We utilize the use of layout structure like the nav, section, div.

CSS and Bootstrap Essay: 
We mostly used bootstrap to layout and design some of our html files, from different sections like navbar, and different div elements. Next is the CSS, we used CSS on changing the other style of the system like hovering, the alignment etc. The design of our system is not completed and many of them are missing and don't have a design. The thing that we can suggest for improvement is to balance the use of bootstrap and CSS for better visualization.  


JAVASCRIPT Essay: 
Our game is powered by javascript , which handles the functionality of our system such as the timer, the verification of the answers, updating the scores, etc. While the other functionality is working fine, some of them are not working like the buzzer beater and the background music function to enhance the user experience. The thing we can suggest is to focus on the important functionality first so that the process of developing the other functionality will be smooth.
